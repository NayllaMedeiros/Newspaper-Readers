# Newspaper-Readers
Identifying the individual characteristics that represent the profile of regular readers.

## Introdution
This project was a group challenge provided in a Bootcamp carried out by Le Wagoh and the company Closer Consulting, a leading reference in Data & AI in Portugal, based on a real case about newspaper readers.
Together with my group, I developed an analysis to better understand the characteristics of regular newspaper readers.

Without insights into the demographic, behavioral, and socio-economic factors that influence reading habits, publishers may struggle to tailor their content and marketing strategies toresonatewith their audience.

## Requirements
For this project we used:
- Python, Notebook 3.6
- Numpy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Steps
* We started by importing the libraries, then we loaded the data and started analyzing the number of rows/columns, detailed information on the data format, statistical descriptions, among other things 
* Then we started cleaning the data to make sure it was of good quality.
* And then we started analyzing the characteristics and insights of regular newspaper readers, we made graphs for better visualization.

## Conclusion
After analyzing statistically, making relationships between the characteristics we had in the data, and putting them into graphs, we were able to observe who the most regular readers were, and one of the most striking characteristics were: age (between 40 and 70 years old), and Portuguese nationality were the who read the newspaper the most.
